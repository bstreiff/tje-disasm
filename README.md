This is an analysis of the Sega Genesis game "Toejam and Earl".

Two known revisions of this game exist:

CRC32:    d1b36786
md5sum:   0a6af20d9c5b3ec4e23c683f083b92cd

CRC32:    7a588f4b
md5sum:   72dc91fd2c5528b384f082a38db9ddda
sha1sum:  85e8d0a4fac591b25b77c35680ac4175976f251b

REV 00 exists as a cartridge.
REV 02 appears to be the version currently distributed on Steam.

This analysis is presently focused on the REV 00 version.

It it unknown what substantial differences exist between the two, other
than that REV 02 contains additional code in some places which causes
offsets of things that come later to be shifted around. :(
